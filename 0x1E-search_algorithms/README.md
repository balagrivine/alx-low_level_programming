What is a search algorithm - A search algirith is an algorith used to lacate a value in a given data set

What is a linear search - Linear search algorithm is an algorithm that searches for an element in a data set sequentially such that each and every element is traversed and the search reaches the end of the data set if the element is not found

What is a binary search - Binary search is  a search algorith in which the data set it traversed in intervals by dividing it in half and comparing the middle element to the target element

What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs - Binary search is the most efficient due to it time complexity of O(logn)
